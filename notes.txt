-Each rigid body needs to reference a collision shape. 
The collision shape is for collisions only, and thus has no concept of mass, inertia, restitution, etc. 
If you have many bodies that use the same collision shape [eg every spaceship in your simulation is a 5-unit-radius sphere], 
it is good practice to have only one Bullet (ammo.js) collision shape, and share it among all those bodies

- if we want a rigid body to be static (ie, not move by any forces), we set the mass to 0 (then it has infinite mass)

-  we loop through the rigidBodies array for each threejs object in it we get its associated ammo.js rigid body, 
obtain the world transform, apply the obtained transform to the transform of the threejs object

- we use collision filtering to select which sets of objects collides and which sets donâ€™t.

- ensure collisions are reflected in both objects involved. eg, we have rigid bodies A and B. 
In the function 'create_A()', we set it to collide with B. 
However, in the function create_B(), we do not set it to collide with A. Then when A collides with B, A will go through B.

- 3 types of joints - point-to-point (like elbow), hinge (like door), slider (like sliding door), cone-twist (useful for ragdoll)
